                <h2>biography</h2>
                <p>Yukihiro Matsumoto (まつもとゆきひろ, Matsumoto Yukihiro, born 14 April 1965), also known as Matz, is a Japanese computer scientist and software programmer best known as the chief designer of the Ruby programming language and its original reference implementation, Matz's Ruby Interpreter (MRI). His demeanor has brought about a motto in the Ruby community: "Matz is nice and so we are nice," commonly abbreviated as MINASWAN.

                As of 2011, Matsumoto is the Chief Architect of Ruby at Heroku, an online cloud platform-as-a-service in San Francisco. He is a fellow of Rakuten Institute of Technology, a research and development organisation in Rakuten Inc. He was appointed to the role of technical advisor for VASILY, Inc. starting in June 2014.</p>

            <h2>Trivia</h2>

            <h3>RUBY nearly did't exist!!! </h3>
            <p>In 1994, Ruby was secretly made during the first hours of the workday for the large company Matsumato worked for. He decided to change jobs and thought it only right to ask his superior what they would like to do with the project he had been doing on company time. His boss laughed and said, “you made it take it with you” . Nowadays it could be a major compliance issue. At that point, the fate of ruby could have been very different <br>
            Fortunately, Matsumato was able to continue developing Ruby even after changing jobs. Truth be told,  though he wasn’t proud to say he was primarily working on ruby during work hours. He maintains that the work he was doing for his employer was also decent. At that time, he used to go to the office by subway, working for about 20 minutes for the company during the train ride and an addition to 20 minutes on the way home.  he finish the day's work in 40 minutes allowing him to spend the remaining time focusing on Ruby</p>   
            <h3> Work</h3>
            <p> He works for the Japanese open source company Netlab.jp. Matsumoto is known as one of the open source evangelists in Japan. He has released several open source products, including cmail, the Emacs-based mail user agent, written entirely in Emacs Lisp. Ruby is his first piece of software that has become known outside Japan.</p>   
                
            <h3> Ruby</h3>
            <p>Matsumoto released the first version of the Ruby programming language on 21 December 1995. He still leads the development of the language's reference implementation, MRI (for Matz's Ruby Interpreter).</p>    
                
            <h3> MRuby</h3>
            <p>In April 2012, Matsumoto open-sourced his work on a new implementation of Ruby called mruby. It is a minimal implementation based on his virtual machine, called ritevm, and is designed to allow software developers to embed Ruby in other programs while keeping memory footprint small and performance optimised.</p>    
                
            <h3> Streem</h3>
             <p>In December 2014, Matsumoto open-sourced his work on a new scripting language called streem, a concurrent language based on a programming model similar to shell, with influences from Ruby, Erlang and other functional programming languages.</p>

            <p>Born in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, he was raised in Tottori Prefecture from the age of four. According to an interview conducted by Japan Inc., he was a self-taught programmer until the end of high school. He graduated with an information science degree from University of Tsukuba, where he was a member of Ikuo Nakata's research lab on programming languages and compilers.</p>
