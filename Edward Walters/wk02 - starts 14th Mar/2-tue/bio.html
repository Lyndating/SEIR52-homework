                <strong>Early Life and Education</strong><br>
                Ada Lovelace was born in London, England, UK on December 10, 1815. She was named Augusta Ada Byron. Her surname changed after she married.
                
                Her father was the brilliant, yet notorious poet Lord Byron (mad, bad and dangerous to know!) and her mother was Anne Isabella Milbanke. Her father was one of the greats of poetry, but his personality was unstable. Her mother was highly intelligent, had been well-educated by private tutors, and was particularly enthusiastic about mathematics and the sciences.

                <strong>She died tragically young</strong><br>
                In the 1850s, Ada fell ill with uterine cancer, likely exacerbated by the extensive blood-letting of her physicians. In the final months of her life, her mother Annabella took complete control of who she had access to, excluding many of her friends and close confidants in the process. She also influenced Ada to undertake a religious transformation, repenting her previous conduct.<br>

                Three months later on 27 November 1852, Ada died aged 36 â€“ the same age her father had been at his death. She was buried beside him in St Mary Magdalene Church in Huckall, Nottinghamshire, where a simple inscription pays tribute to the incredible scientist, mathematician, and pioneering force she was.
