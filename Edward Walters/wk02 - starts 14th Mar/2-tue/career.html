                <strong>She wrote the first published computer program</strong><br>
                In 1842, Ada was commissioned to translate a French transcript of one of Babbage’s lectures into English. Adding her own section simply titled ‘Notes’, Ada went on to write a detailed collection of her own ideas on Babbage’s computing machines that ended up being more extensive than the transcript itself! <strong>In Note G, she explained in perfect detail, how to use the Analytical Engine to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers. </strong>

                <strong>She thought deeply about how technology could be used</strong><br>
                Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, containing what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.
