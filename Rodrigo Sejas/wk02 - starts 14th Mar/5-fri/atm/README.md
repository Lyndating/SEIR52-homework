#Title: ATM App

- What happens when the user wants to withdraw more money from the checking
  account than is in the account? These accounts have overdraft protection, so if
  a withdrawal can be covered by the balances in both accounts, take the checking
  balance down to $0 and take the rest of the withdrawal from the savings account.
  If the withdrawal amount is more than the combined account balance, ignore it.

- Make sure there is overdraft protection going both ways.

- Are there ways to refactor your code to make it DRYer?
