            <h3>Early Life and Career</h3>

            <img class = 'trivia-image' src="images/background.jpeg" alt="Margaret" width = '700' height ='335'>

            <p>Landing men on the moon with just over 32,000 bits of Random Access Memory (that's 0.004 megabytes!) probably wasn't the kind of high-wire act that Margaret Heafield Hamilton imagined for herself growing up in the midwest. Born on August 17, 1936, in the town of Paoli, Indiana, her family soon moved to Michigan where, after graduating from Hancock High School in 1954, she attended the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, for a time. </p>
            <p>She soon transferred to Earlham College, back in her birth state of Indiana, though, graduating with a bachelor's degree in mathematics, with a minor in philosophy. Hamilton credits the head of the college's science department, Florence Long, for inspiring her to pursue a career in abstract math.</p>
                
            <p>While at Earlham, Hamilton also met her first husband, James Cox Hamilton, who was a senior at the college, studying chemistry. They married on June 15, 1958, and after her husband graduated from Earlham and the couple moved to Boston. There, they had a daughter, Lauren, in 1959, and Hamilton was all set to enroll in a graduate mathematics program at Brandeis University when fate took a fortuitous turn.</p>
