                <p>While originally brought in to Draper as a programmer, Hamilton quickly moved up in the lab until she was eventually put in charge of all of the software development for the Apollo command module's guidance computer, and later on, for the Apollo lunar lander guidance computer as well.</p>

                <p>"Many of the things I was intrigued by had to do with how to make the mission software safe and reliable," Hamilton said. "And one of the things I remember trying very hard to do was to get permission to be able to put more error detection and recovery into the software."</p>

                <p>That additional code meant more for the programmers at Draper to have to debug, so there was initially some resistance to this during the early Apollo missions, but eventually, Hamilton got her way.</p>

                <p>Hamilton's doggedness for tracking down errors in the Apollo Guidance Computer's code also inspired a much more rigorous approach to programming than existed at the time.</p>

                <p>"We began to analyze all of the errors that had taken place on the flight software when we were actually in Validation & Verification mode," Hamilton said. "When each of many of the error reports came in asking for 'reason for error,' the engineers would fill in a response and they would just say 'bug' and that wasn't enough.</p>

                <p>"So we got very interested in how we wrote errors up, so that if we understood the error, then we could maybe prevent it on the next mission. We did a thorough analysis of the on board flight software, including the errors themselves, and began to categorized those errors. For example, one category is if you took certain steps, it would have been eliminated. Another category, if you took certain steps, it would have been eliminated."</p>

                <p>This more systematized approach to software programming inspired Hamilton to start calling it software engineering, and the term has stuck ever since.</p>
