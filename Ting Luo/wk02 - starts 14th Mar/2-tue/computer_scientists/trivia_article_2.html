                <h3>Moving to MIT</h3>

                <p>Margaret Hamilton began working with Edward Lorenz, the father of Chaos Theory, in MIT's meteorology department. As part of her work there, Hamilton learned how to program using the PDP-1 and LGP-30 computers to create predictive models for weather forecasting.</p>

                <p>Since computer science and programming weren't yet established fields that you could study in their own right, early programmers like Hamilton more or less had to learn on the job. "Computer science and software engineering were not yet disciplines;" Hamilton told The Guardian in 2019, "instead, programmers learned on the job. Lorenz's love for software experimentation was contagious, and I caught the bug."</p>
                    
                <p>Soon, in 1961, Hamilton would move onto the SAGE project at MIT's Lincoln Lab, a project for the US Air Force to help identify potential enemy aircraft. Here, she continued to develop her skills as a programmer, and soon others were taking notice of her work.</p>

                <p>"What they used to do when you came into this organization as a beginner, was to assign you this program which nobody was able to ever figure out or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to me as well," Hamilton recalled in 2001.</p>
                
                <p>"And what had happened was it was tricky programming, and the person who wrote it took delight in the fact that all of his comments were in Greek and Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually got it to work. It even printed out its answers in Latin and Greek. I was the first one to get it to work."</p>
                
                <p>Before long, her work got her noticed and she started being considered as a candidate for the lead software developer role for NASA's upcoming Apollo missions, and eventually became the director of the software division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, later renamed to the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, which was hard at work putting together the Apollo program's guidance computer. While she had planned to begin a graduate degree in abstract math at Brandeis University, the U.S. space program "won her heart". Thanks to the success of her work at SAGE, she was the first programmer hired for the Apollo project at MIT.</p>
