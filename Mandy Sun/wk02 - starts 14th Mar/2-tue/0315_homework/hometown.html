            <h3>HOMETOWN</h3>
            <p>Margaret Hamilton, née Margaret Heafield, (born August 17, 1936, Paoli, Indiana, U.S.), American computer
                scientist who was one of the first computer software programmers; she created the term software engineer
                to
                describe her work. She helped write the computer code for the command and lunar modules used on the
                Apollo
                missions to the Moon in the late 1960s and early ’70s.
            </p>
            <p>While studying mathematics and philosophy at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, she met James
                Hamilton,
                and they subsequently married. After graduating in 1958, she taught high-school mathematics for a short
                time. The couple then moved to Boston. Although Margaret planned to study abstract mathematics at
                Brandeis
                University, she accepted a job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) while her husband
                attended
                Harvard Law School. At MIT she began programming software to predict the weather and did postgraduate
                work
                in meteorology.</p>

            <h3>TRIVIA</h3>
            <p>In 1976, Hamilton co-founded with Saydean Zeldin a company called Higher Order Software (HOS) to further
                develop ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from their experience at MIT working
                on
                the Apollo program. They created a product called USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology they
                developed at MIT. It was successfully used in numerous government programs including a
                project to formalize and implement C-IDEF, an automated version of IDEF, a modeling language developed
                by
                the U.S. Air Force in the Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) project. In 1980,
                British-Israeli computer scientist David Harel published a proposal for a structured programming
                language
                derived from HOS from the viewpoint of and/or subgoals. Others have used HOS to formalize the semantics
                of linguistic quantifiers,and to formalize the design of reliable real-time embedded systems.</p>
            <p>Hamilton was the CEO of HOS through 1984 and left the company in 1985. In March 1986, she founded
                Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal
                Systems Language (USL) and its associated automated environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her
                paradigm
                of development before the fact for systems design and software development.</p>
