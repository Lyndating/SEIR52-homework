            If Turing was the father of computing then John Von Neumann was the cool rich uncle!

            <div class="item">Was a consultant for the Manhattan project. And employed by the military and navy. Worked on a project with the ENIAC computer, a vacuum tube computer running on decimal arithmitic that was supposed to be programmed to shoot guns. He tried to make it into a general purpose computer and used it to do some calculations relating to the development of the atomic bomb.</div>
            <div class="item">Pioneered creating general purpose, electronic computers, that were binary based. There were several "Turing Complete" computers at the time but they were either general purpose but electro-mechanical or electronic and special purpose. At Moore School at Pennsylvania, worked on EDVAC(electronic, discrete, variable, automatic, computer), the successor to ENIAC in 1946.</div>
            <div class="item"> Famous for creating Von Neumann Architecture. Basically means: to build a computer you need a store (memory) to hold instructions an data. A control unit (CPU) and an arithmitic and logic unit (now also in the CPU) and input units. Still very similar to computers today.</div>
