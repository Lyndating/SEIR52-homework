            If Turing was the father of computing then John Von Neumann was the cool rich uncle!

        <div class="grid-item grid-item-3">Born on December 28, 1903 in Budapest, Hungary and was born to a non-jewish observant family. His dad was super rich and was basically a baron. He was a super smart kid. He could divide one digit number by another 8 digit number in his head when he was 6 (This kid had mad skills). He was a talented polymath and top in his class in everything. He was basically the kid that your mum would wish you could be like in highschool.He completed his education up to his PhD in Budapest and ended up in Gottingen University in Germany. He became a research assistant for other super smart dude David Hilbert. He wore super snazzy pinstripe suits that made him look even smarter(Dude's drip was on point).Got offered a job from Princeton University in New Jersey. Actually met Turing at Cambridge in his mid 30's because he gave lectures there.

        <div class="grid-item grid-item-4"> Became a full Professor of Mathematics at Princeton in his early 30's (which is apparently super young...what are we doing with our lives). Joined the Institute of Advanced Studies which is basically a smart people club for super smart people. Like Einstein. Got offered to be a professor there so...yeah he's pretty f**cking smart. Got to chillax with Turing a lot in 1938 at Princeton and IAS and actually offered Turing a job as his reserach assistant so he wouldn't be involved in the WW2 effort back in England. Turing turned it down and now there's a movie about him featuring Benedryl Cucumbercatch.</div>

            In 1955 he was diagnosed with cancer in his collarbone. This was probably dude to his exposure to radiation while working in Los Alamos National Laboratory. He was actually super freaked out by his impending death. (I mean...i would be if i was that awesome), and invited a Catholic preist for consultation. He was agnostic for most of his life until his deathbed, where he suddenly converted to catholicism. He died February 8, 1957 in Washington, D.C.
